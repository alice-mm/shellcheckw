# ===== Configuration

# Path to shellcheck, or just the program's name if it is in your $PATH.
# You can add arguments in the array, too.

    # ShellCheck often thinks we want expansion to happen in
    # strings that do not even contain “$(foo)” nor “$bar” and
    # tries to force us to use double quotes in places where it would
    # force us to escape boatloads of things.
    SC2016
    
    # “warning: This redirection doesn't have a command.
    # Move to its command (or use 'true' as no-op).”
    # It's a feature. Even their Wiki page says this.
    # I often use “> foo” to empty a file.
    SC2188
    
    # “note: Prefer explicit -n to check non-empty string
    # (or use =/-ne to check boolean/integer).”
    # Their logic to issue this note is that users not familiar with
    # the language will not understand that well, but c'mon, I don't
    # see why the “-n” version would be more easy to understand.
    # The guy will end up checking the manual or something anyway.
    # The simple fact that the message tells stuff about “booleans”
    # make me want to ignore that note since “real” booleans do not
    # even exist in Bash.
