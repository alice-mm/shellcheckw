# shellcheckw

A wrapper around ShellCheck, and a wrapper around that wrapper to inspect Git revisions.

I love ShellCheck, but it yields a few false positives that annoy me a lot, and I don't have the time to try to see if I can contribute to the project itself right now, so I made a wrapper that tries to calm ShellCheck down a little on a few things:

```
$ ./shellcheckw path/to/a/script
```

Additionally, I wrapped this wrapper in a script able to do these two things:

* find shell scripts recursively from files and directories, or
* find shell scripts that were modified between two Git revisions of a project, using commit hashes or branch names or whatever.

```
$ ./shellcheckw-apply-to.sh -h

  Usage:

    shellcheckw-apply-to.sh REVISION_A REVISION_B [path/to/project/]
    shellcheckw-apply-to.sh -p PATH...
    shellcheckw-apply-to.sh -h

  The first form checks scripts that were modified between the two given
  Git revisions (commits, branches...). You can explicitly give the path
  to a Git project so that the script will move to it before checking
  anything.
  
  The second form checks scripts found by searching recursively from the
  given paths. The paths can lead to nondirectory files themselves,
  in which case these files will be checked.

  The “-h” option prints this help message and exits.

```

As an interesting exercise, I also added unit-test-like scripts that do a great job in helping me building nice functions.

I wrote most of this during my free time, but the main motivation source was to be able to provide something at least a little bit useful to Yseop (https://yseop.com/). Anyone is free to use that stuff for anything legal, but if you show some gratitude and leave a link to the repository or to my website or anything I'll be happier, of course.
